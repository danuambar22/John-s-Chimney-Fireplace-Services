                <h2>How often should I have my chimney swept?</h2>
                <p>We recommend having your chimney swept at least once a year, preferably before the start of the
                    heating season. Regular sweeping removes soot and creosote buildup, reducing the risk of chimney
                    fires.</p>

                <p>Signs that your chimney needs an inspection include smoke backdrafts, visible cracks in the chimney,
                    unusual odors, or excessive creosote buildup. If you notice any of these, it's time to schedule an
                    inspection.</p>

                <h2>Why is creosote buildup dangerous?</h2>
                <p>Creosote is a highly flammable substance that accumulates inside the chimney from burning wood. If
                    not removed, it can lead to chimney fires, which are extremely dangerous. Regular chimney sweeping
                    helps prevent creosote buildup.</p>
